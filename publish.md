### Publishing Your HPC Exercises to GitHub

Now that you've completed the exercises and tracked your work with Git locally, let's publish your repository to GitHub for future reference and sharing.

#### Prerequisites
- A GitHub account
- Git configured on your local machine
- Your completed exercises in a local Git repository

#### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) (create an account if you haven't already)
2. Click the "+" button in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - Choose a repository name (e.g., "hpc-exercises" or "slurm-training")
   - Add a short description (optional)
   - Keep it public
   - **Important:** Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license as you already have a local repository
5. Click "Create repository"

#### Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

Make sure you're in your exercise directory:
```bash
# Verify you're in the correct directory
cd hpc-exercises

# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git

# Verify the remote was added successfully
git remote -v
```

#### Step 3: Push Your Work to GitHub

Push all your work to GitHub:
```bash
# Push your main branch
git push -u origin main   # use 'master' instead of 'main' if that's your branch name
```

#### Step 4: Verify Your Repository

1. Visit `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME`
2. You should see:
   - All your exercise files
   - Your commit history
   - The .gitignore file
   - All tracked scripts

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues

##### Authentication Issues
If you get an authentication error, you need to either:
1. Set up SSH keys:
   ```bash
   # Generate SSH key
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   
   # Add to GitHub account (copy the public key content)
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
   Then add this key to your GitHub account settings

2. Or use a Personal Access Token:
   - Go to GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
   - Generate new token
   - Use token as password when pushing

##### Unrelated Histories Error
If you get a rejection due to unrelated histories:
```bash
# Pull and allow unrelated histories
git pull --allow-unrelated-histories origin main

# Resolve any conflicts if they occur

# Try pushing again
git push -u origin main
```

#### Next Steps

1. Consider adding additional documentation:
   - Add a README.md file describing your exercises
   - Include setup instructions for future reference

2. Keep your repository updated:
   ```bash
   # When you make more changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new exercise solutions"
   git push
   ```

#### Best Practices

1. Keep sensitive information out of your repository
2. Make sure your .gitignore is properly set up
3. Use meaningful commit messages
4. Document any special setup or requirements

**Note:** Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` and `YOUR-REPO-NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name in all commands.
